# Exposure: An app to meet new people

> As the world becomes ever more caught up in the
online sphere, people are increasingly relying on
dating apps in order to meet partners. However,
dating applications have been postulated to promote the objectification of users, catalyse discrimination and eradicate the slow, intimate courtship
that traditionally precedes falling in love. Previous
application developers have sought to overcome
these issues through obscuring a user’s physical
appearance until they have engaged in a sufficient
level of conversation with their match. However,
in these applications, discrimination can still occur
based on factors other than users’ physical appearance. Other applications have
taken a different approach to decreasing superficiality in dating apps, encouraging users to play
games to get to know one another better. Unfortunately, users still complain that this doesn’t prevent
people choosing a match based on their physical
appearances. Our application intends to extend upon these previous applications,
obscuring not just the physical appearance of our
users, but all traits, letting these traits be exposed
one at a time as the users interact with each other.
We will also exploit gamification within our app,
using simple games to generate more meaningful
conversations amongst users, allowing them to get
to know each other for more than just their surface level appearances and traits. We propose that
through combining and extending upon previous
techniques, we can remove the superficiality plaguing modern day mobile dating.
